# Wii Sports
*Wii Sports* is a team for Dr. Kaputa's Embedded Systems Design II class for the Spring 2025 semester at RIT. 

## Introduction + Switch From BitBucket
We plan to make our tennis tracker inspired by *Wii Sports*, hence the name! Initially, we planned to use *BitBucket* due to its seamless interaction with Jira, which we are using for team organization, but decided to switch to *GitHub* due to the **lower bar of learning** associated with it.
## Team Details
Each teammate in this team of seven has their own major role, alongside responsabilities, and potentially subroles. Our initial outline for roles is as follows, but subject to change by the end of this project, and will be updated to reflect that as work is completed.
